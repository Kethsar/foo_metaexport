# foo_metaexport
Foobar2000 component that exports metadata to a meta.txt file in the location of your choosing.

Developed and built using Visual Studio 2015 and Foobar SDK 2015-08-3 on Windows 7.

I have never touched C++ before this so expect problems.

## Compiling
1. Download the Foobar2000 SDK.
2. Create a folder inside the foobar2000 folder (Where the ATLHelpers, SDK, etc. folders are) and add these files.
3. Open the solution file. If it does not work, create a new one and add this project along with the foobar2000_SDK, foobar2000_sdk_helpers, foobar2000_component_client, foobar2000_ATL_helpers, and pfc projects.
4. Compile.
